647 Chutes and Ladders

A popular board game for children is called “Chutes and Ladders”. The board has squares which are
numbered from 1 to 100, and players have counters which start on the theoretical square 0. The players
take turns at throwing a die with the numbers 1 to 6 on it, and each moves his or her counter forward
the number of squares corresponding to the number on the die (the square they reach is found by adding
the die number to the square number their counter is on). The first person to reach square 100 is the
winner.
The interest is caused by the fact that pairs of squares are connected together by “ladders” (which
connect a lower-numbered square to a higher-numbered square) and “chutes” (which run from high to
low). If a counter lands on the start of a chute or ladder (i.e., this is the square reached after throwing
the die), then the counter is moved to the corresponding square at the end of the chute or ladder.
Note that landing on the end square of a ladder or a chute has no effect, only the start square counts.
Furthermore, there are some squares such that if a player’s counter lands on them, then the player must
either miss the next turn, or immediately throw the die again for another turn, depending on what is
written on the board. A miss-a-turn or extra-turn square is never the start or end of a ladder or chute.
If a player is on square 95 or higher, then a die throw which takes them past 100 must be ignored —
thus a player on square 99 must ignore all throws which are not 1.
